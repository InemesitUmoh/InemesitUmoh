I'm Inemesit Friday Umoh, and I do data and business intelligence analysis. I enjoy collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets from various sources, including spreadsheets, databases, and secondary sources to identify trends, improve performance and processes, and make data-driven decision-making. I also enjoy developing and maintaining dashboards, visualizing data insights, and collaborating with cross-functional teams and leadership to meet business objectives. I'm life-long learner, open to learn new tools and processes to help businesses and organisations make informed decisions.

Skills: Python / SQL / Power BI / Microsoft Excel / BiqQuery/Git
